/**
 * Driver for the MAX77654 I²C driven battery charge controller (PMIC).
 * https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX77654.pdf
 * There are at least 5 Different voltage outputs.
 * Main Power Rail:
 * - 1.8V Power Rail: MCU and the Touch IC, Always on.
 * Auxillary Power Rails, tured ON by MCU in a specific routine, in driver/board.c.
 * - 1.2V Power Rail
 * - 2.7V Power Rail
 * - 10V Power Rail
 * - LED Power Rail: Can be tured OFF.
 * @bug Right now a little underpowered: there is a 18 sec delay after turning the power for every module.
 * @bug Occassionally boot failure is also noticed right now.
